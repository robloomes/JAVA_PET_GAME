  What is it?
  -----------
  
  The game is a basic pet game implenting a GUI that showcases
  basic event driven programming. It is written in Java and coded
  on elipse. It should be executable from any Java based IDE
  or from the command line. The basics of the game involve owning
  several pets, interacting with them which will affect their
  behaviour and actions. Muliple players can compete with a basic 
  system. Scores are based on keeping your pets healthy and happy.
  
  The Latest Version
  ------------------
  
  This is the first fully runnable version of the GUI based game.
  The GUI in itself was developed and adapted from a command-line,
  text based game implementing the same gameplay, processes and logic.
